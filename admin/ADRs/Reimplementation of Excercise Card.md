# Reimplementation of Excercise Card

 - Status: accepted
 - Deciders: Luffy, David, Hamza, Lebin

## Context and Problem Statement

The excercise card code we inherited was a heavy mixture of JS, HTML, and CSS all in the same JS file. Understanding or adding functionality to it was pretty much impossible 

## Considered Options

 - Refactor the code by separation into different files
 - Reimplement the code

## Decision outcome

Went through with reimplementation

## Pros and cons
Pros:
 - Much easier and faster than trying to rearrange the existing mess, which is extremely important for a blocking task
 - Saves us from other issues in the existing code that we could have not noticed due to code unreadability

Cons:
 - Not allowed (lifted by professor after review)
