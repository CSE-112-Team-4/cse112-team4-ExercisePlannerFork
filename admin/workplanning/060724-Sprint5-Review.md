### Conclusion / Closing Thoughts / Notes From Check-in With TA (Jason)

- Overall, we think our project was refined from what we carried over from cse 110 in terms of logic separation and readability as well as features.
    - we were able to refactor a lot of code and also add Login, Sort, Error Handle, etc
- thoughts: 
    - most work was done by maybe half the team, not too healthy workload balance
