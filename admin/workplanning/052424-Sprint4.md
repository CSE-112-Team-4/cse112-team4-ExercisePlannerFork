## Sprint 3 Retrospective

### Retrospective Review

**What Worked / Who Accomplished What:**

#### Non Coding

- [x] **Migrating Single Source of Truth** (Priority: <span style="color:red">HIGH</span>)
  - Accomplished by: Luffy, John
- [x] **Documentation Administration (Code of conduct, ADRs, Team Page)** (Priority: <span style="color:red">HIGH</span>)
  - Accomblished by: David

- [x] **Finish Refactoring** (Priority: <span style="color:red">HIGH</span>)
  - Accomplished by: Luffy, Hamza

- **Testing** (Priority: <span style="color:yellow">MEDIUM</span>)
  - Unit testing is completed, web component testing is in-progress

**What Didn't Work / Proposed Solution:**

- The pair-programming approach that we used this sprint worked much more effective than individualizing work
  - We will keep continuing with this approach

**Notes / Concerns:**

- Technical things to note:
  - web component testing seems involving and difficult to implement. Daniel and John have consulted the prof about possible ways of testing and also found other resources [medium article](https://medium.com/@pietmichal/how-to-test-a-web-component-b5d64d5e8bb0) that they will try to implement.
  - there is an issue with rendering html components that we have to figure out.

### Conclusion / Closing Thoughts / Notes From Check-in With TA (Jason)

- Considering that we have our midterm on Wednesday (5/29) and that we have to design questions for them, we want to prioritize the exam over our project for a brief period of time.
  - we aren't enforcing hard deadline on coding tasks, but we are aiming to complete as much as we can by next friday. note that we still do have some time after midterm.
