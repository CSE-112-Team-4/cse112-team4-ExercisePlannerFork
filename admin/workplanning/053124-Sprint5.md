### Conclusion / Closing Thoughts / Notes From Check-in With TA (Jason)

- As we expected from last week, we focused out efforts to creating midterm questions and preparing for it. As a result, we didn't get much work completed for the project. 
- We will continue the same tasks from last week and keep the same division of work.

  - focus on ui (implement different fonts on different device, more modern looking)
