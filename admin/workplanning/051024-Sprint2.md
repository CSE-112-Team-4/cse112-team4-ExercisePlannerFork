**What Didn't Work / Proposed Solution:**

- We're finding it difficult to finish the administrative things, especially given that it is midterm weeks.
  - Solution: This week, We will attempt to individualize workload and see how far each of us can get done. Experimenting with team dynamic / work attitude.

**Notes / Concerns:**

- ExerciseCard.js needs a MAJOR refactoring
- Wireframe needs more details
  - Only a single wireframe was completed

### Conclusion / Closing Thoughts / Notes From Check-in With TA (Jason)

- We each have different thoughts about dividing up workload. While Ilan feels that individualizing work is more effective, Luffy is leaning towards pair-programming, meeting with smaller groups to achieve tasks. For this week, we will try out the individual approach and see how things will go.
- We realize that there is a lot of refactoring to do. We will concentrate on refactoring then come back to tasks that we need for features.
- Discussion with Jason about ADS's: "Seems like you would do it for documenting decisions on implementing features (of at least a sizable scope), and it documents the deliberations that were brought up regarding that feature"
