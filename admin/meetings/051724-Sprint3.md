# 5/17 Notes

## Participants
Luffy, John, Hamza, Daniel, David, Lebin, Ilan

## Sprint 2 Retrospective

- Overview: In the previous sprints, we attempted to divide the work to individuals in an attempt to make some - progress in our repo. This ultimately backfired as some work didn’t get done.
  - So for the next sprint, we’re enforcing pairs in each task.
- Lebin created a local demo of using a database (username and password)
- Daniel was checking how to implement the database in javascript, but held off changes for code refactor
- John did not pull his weight
- David made the wireframes. Uploaded to the Google Drive group repo
- Ilan created the new superlinter and made a pull request with the updated style changes
  - Advised a VS code extension to force adherence to style
- Hamza focused on CSS changes. Held off changes for code refactor
- Luffy carried the team. Did the code refactor.
  - Almost done, while some of the buttons currently don’t work, the structure has been completely redone and MUCH cleaner
