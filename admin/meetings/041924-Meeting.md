# 4/19 Notes
- Current Tentative times for IN-PERSON MEETINGS are : Friday 11am-1pm , Sat 4pm - 6pm , Sunday 4pm - 8pm, Maybe before class if people have time.
  * Currently leaning towards the Friday times.
- Team Video:
  * We'll each record ~20 secs of intro, Hamza and I have to add some extra for our repo explanation.
Then each take a picture of yourself (doing a pose probably). 
  * We're thinking of trying out a smash style video as the intro. If that fails, we'll fall back on a boring style.
  * Upload stuff to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16NJiFwhu2OiG3SFbfuZPqU8SRGt6fYK0?usp=sharing
