# Code of Conduct

This is team 4's code of conduct. Please follow it when working on the project.

## General

 - Message in slack when you miss a meeting. We need to track who attended what.


  

## Github

 - Either write commit descriptions, or write the issue numbers is description, same for pull requests.
 - 2 people need to approve a pull request to merge to main
 - Read the pull requests before approving them. If the code is unclear or uncommented, reject it and explain why. If the code takes you more than 15 minutes to understand after you've read it, it's probably either too messy or uncommented
 - Branches should be named as the stories/tasks they're dedicated to, incluing the story/task numbers
 - When doing a task, mark the corresponding issue as "In Progress" on the board. 
 - Tasks need to be related to stories: "US/DS[story number] - [task number] [Task name]"
 - Check the board for existing issues before adding new ones
 - When adding issues to the repository, add them to the board as well
 - Tag the issues when adding them to the board


  

## Code

 - Use the linters/prettier
 - Try to keep css, js, and html separate
 - Keep the code commented
