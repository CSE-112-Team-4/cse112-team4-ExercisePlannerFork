* Web app
​
## Decision Outcome
​
Chosen option: Website

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->
### Web app
​
* Good, more streamlined for phone users
* Good, web app, not like a mobile app, can easily adapted to whatever devices the user is using
* Good, easy to maintain
* Good, users can manipulate the data on the page
* Bad, maybe slower
* Bad, Would require developers to learn Script(iOS) or the app developer for android devices
* Bad, App breaks each time the phone updates
* Bad, phones have wide range of aspect ratios. We would need to make sure our app works for all of them
* Bad, require authentication
​
### Website
​
* Good, It is faster to finish the project with website format
* Good, This is what CSE110 labs have been teaching and the data is easier to import.
* Good, Most computers stick to a standard aspect ratio. (16:9)
* Good, resistant to updates when compared to apps. (HTML, CSS, and JS are core foundations.)
* Neutral, The final product is built for websites. Easier for computers to use (mouse and keyboard), but harder for phones to use.
* Bad, A website like this is usually build for phones in order to be more "portable" (as compared to a laptop)
* Bad, may have less interaction with users
