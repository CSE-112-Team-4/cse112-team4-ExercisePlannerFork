## Discussion:
- start with CI/CD pipeline
- Come up plan with smaller groups and divide work(still collaborate with each other)
  - Some focus on unit testing, CI/CD pipeline
    - What if the group finished CI/CD, what else do they do? [ask Gagan]
    - Ci/CD depends on how we are proceeding with project
    - Gagan gave us some resources in terms of researching unit testing for JS
      - [Jest](https://restfulraccoons.slack.com/archives/C049MAY2P2R/p1667783600469049)
  - Others can be on coding actual project
- Standups start Monday 11/7

## Design decisions:
- Complete vs not complete exercises for grouping
  - When exercise is completed will be moved to completed group
- Dates - date input using [type=date] in html instead of having users type in themselves
  - Can also use date created for exercises
  - Should we parse or combine exercises according to date
- Going towards mysql for storage [Will ask Gagan about best choice for storage]
  - Only a few members are familiar with mysql
  - Needs additional set up, local server, can set up problems for users. Maybe too complex for our app goal. 
  - MangoDB, JSON possible options
## Work Assignments:
- Aleksa on UI
- Tim & Regan on CI/CD
