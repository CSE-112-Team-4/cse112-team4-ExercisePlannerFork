### Communication Expectations

All members will be expected to read emails and Slack posts from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.

### Meeting Scheduling

The team will agree at the end of each class to set any meeting times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. Team leaders will send out reminders if the meeting has an agenda within eight hours after the class.

### General Responsibilities

Members will do their best to meet their assigned deadlines, communicating beforehand with either the leads or the entire team if they are unable to do so. Members will also be respectful to one another and ensure that they are creating a comfortable environment.

### Conflict Resolution

In the event of a conflict, each team member should agree upon an approach to address the issues that may rise. For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to approach the team member by the leaders or assigned member before bringing the problem to the TA.

### Expectations of Faculty and TAs

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the TA, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
